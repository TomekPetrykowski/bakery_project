# Bakery Website Project

Wecome! It's my first serious website/online shop project. I have designed and coded it during my school practise.
I used PHP, HTML, CSS and a litte bit od Javascript.
Project is still in deployment.

## Installation guide
1. Download Xampp ([link](https://www.apachefriends.org/pl/index.html))
2. Install Xampp according to the tips
3. Start `Apache` and `MySQL` processes in Xampp Control Panel
4. Go to the `C:\xampp\htdocs` directory (on Windows, if installation was default)
5. Download this repository as a ZIP file
6. Extract this in htdocs directory (you may want to change a name of repository directory for shorten one)
7. Open your browser and go to the `localhost/[repository_name]`

If there are some issues with loading products, try refreshing the page. Database with products should have load automatically.
Some styling issues may occur, I'm working on them.
